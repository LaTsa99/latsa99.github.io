In the spring semester of 2021, I had to do a semester project at the university.
This course is about finding a specialization-related topic and an advisor, then the student needs to work on that topic during the semester.
I chose the topic 'Security Analysis of Embedded Software at the Binary Level' which was proposed by [TASZK Security Labs](https://taszk.io/), where I am working since then.
When I first got there, I barely knew anything about kernel or even binary exploitation, I didn't even compile a linux kernel.
During this semester project I had to learn the basics of kernel pwning in order to pwn Android based smartphones later, about which later I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis.
My fellow collegues and mentors helped me to build up the foundations of kernel hacking even on arm64.


I have written all of these informations and experiences into [this](https://github.com/LaTsa99/onlab) github repository.
The notes go through creating a research environment, the basic exploitation techniques and their mitigations, even the basics of the arm64 architecture.
The README file contains all the text, except a CTF challenge writeup, but it is linked there too.
Besides, every code and script is included in the repository.
I hope you can use it well :)
